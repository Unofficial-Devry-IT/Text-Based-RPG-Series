# Text-Based-RPG-Series
Welcome to the Unofficial DeVry IT series where we build a Text-Based RPG together! Each section is taught and recorded, links on our discord! 

The master branch is protected, meaning you cannot directly push to it. Preferrably master should be the latest version of our series. Each lecture/session will be added
as a new branch, then merged into master. That way you can see the code changes between each lecture.

## Contributions / Personal Branches
You're more than welcome to fork this repository if you want and try doing your own thing with it. You're also welcome to create your own branch and do your thang!
